        <p>Growing up as an animal fnatic, I always felt they should be able to retrieve the same treatment us people also do. Dogs get abused quite commonly and it isn't taking as serious as for example a beating of another person. Although they are just pets, they came a long way from just being wild animals. Many dogs actually save our lives and take on real jobs like being a k9 unit. What right do we have as people to disrespct these beloved animals that look out for us before they even care for themselves?<br><br/>Contact An Animal Shelter Now! 212-614-9653</p>
